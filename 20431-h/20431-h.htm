ARGUMENT</a></h3>

<p>Hrothgar, king of the Danes, lives happily and peacefully, and
bethinks him to build a glorious hall called Hart. But a little after,
one Grendel, of the kindred of the evil wights that are come of Cain,
hears the merry noise of Hart and cannot abide it; so he enters
thereinto by night, and slays and carries off and devours thirty of
Hrothgar's thanes. Thereby he makes Hart waste for twelve years, and the
tidings of this mishap are borne wide about lands. Then comes to the
helping of Hrothgar Beowulf, the son of Ecgtheow, a&nbsp;thane of King
Hygelac of the Geats, with fourteen fellows. They are met on the shore
by the land-warder, and by him shown to Hart and the stead of Hrothgar,
who receives them gladly, and to whom Beowulf tells his errand, that he
will help him against Grendel. They feast in the hall, and one Unferth,
son of Ecglaf, taunts Beowulf through jealousy that he was outdone
<span class = "pagenum">vi</span>
by Breca in swimming. Beowulf tells the true tale thereof. And a little
after, at nightfall, Hrothgar and his folk leave the hall Hart, and it
is given in charge to Beowulf, who with his Geats abides there the
coming of Grendel.</p>

<p>Soon comes Grendel to the hall, and slays a man of the Geats, hight
Handshoe, and then grapples with Beowulf, who will use no weapon against
him: Grendel feels himself over-mastered and makes for the door, and
gets out, but leaves his hand and arm behind him with Beowulf: men on
the wall hear the great noise of this battle and the wailing of Grendel.
In the morning the Danes rejoice, and follow the bloody slot of Grendel,
and return to Hart racing and telling old tales, as of Sigemund and the
Worm. Then come the king and his thanes to look on the token of victory,
Grendel's hand and arm, which Beowulf has let fasten: to the
hall-gable.</p>

<p>The king praises Beowulf and rewards him, and they feast in Hart, and
the tale of Finn and Hengest is told. Then Hrothgar leaves Hart, and so
does Beowulf also with his Geats, but the Danes keep guard there.</p>

<p>In the night comes in Grendel's Mother, and catches up Aeschere,
a&nbsp;thane of Hrothgar, and carries him off to her lair. In the
morning is
<span class = "pagenum">vii</span>
Beowulf fetched to Hrothgar, who tells him of this new grief and craves
his help.</p>

<p>Then they follow up the slot and come to a great water-side, and find
thereby Aeschere's head, and the place is known for the lair of those
two: monsters are playing in the deep, and Beowulf shoots one of them to
death. Then Beowulf dights him and leaps into the water, and is a day's
while reaching the bottom. There he is straightway caught hold of by
Grendel's Mother, who bears him into her hall. When he gets free he
falls on her, but the edge of the sword Hrunting (lent to him by
Unferth) fails him, and she casts him to the ground and draws her sax to
slay him; but he rises up, and sees an old sword of the giants hanging
on the wall; he takes it and smites off her head therewith. He sees
Grendel lying dead, and his head also he strikes off; but the blade of
the sword is molten in his venomous blood. Then Beowulf strikes upward,
taking with him the head of Grendel and the hilts of the sword. When he
comes to the shore he finds his Geats there alone; for the Danes fled
when they saw the blood floating in the water.</p>

<p>They go up to Hrothgar's stead, and four men must needs bear the
head. They come to Hrothgar, and Beowulf gives him the hilts and
<span class = "pagenum">viii</span>
tells him what he has done. Much praise is given to Beowulf; and they
feast together.</p>

<p>On the morrow Beowulf bids farewell to Hrothgar, more gifts are
given, and messages are sent to Hygelac: Beowulf departs with the full
love of Hrothgar. The Geats come to their ship and reward the
ship-warder, and put off and sail to their own land. Beowulf comes to
Hygelac's house. Hygelac is told of, and his wife Hygd, and her good
conditions, against whom is set as a warning the evil Queen Thrytho.</p>

<p>Beowulf tells all the tale of his doings in full to Hygelac, and
gives him his gifts, and the precious-gemmed collar to Hygd. Here is
told of Beowulf, and how he was contemned in his youth, and is now grown
so renowned.</p>

<p>Time wears; Hygelac is slain in battle; Heardred, his son, reigns in
his stead, he is slain by the Swedes, and Beowulf is made king. When he
is grown old, and has been king for fifty years, come new tidings.
A&nbsp;great dragon finds on the sea-shore a mound wherein is stored the
treasure of ancient folk departed. The said dragon abides there, and
broods the gold for 300 years.</p>

<p>Now a certain thrall, who had misdone against his lord and was
fleeing from his wrath, haps on the said treasure and takes a cup
thence, which
<span class = "pagenum">ix</span>
he brings to his lord to appease his wrath. The Worm waketh, and findeth
his treasure lessened, but can find no man who hath done the deed.
Therefore he turns on the folk, and wars on them, and burns Beowulf's
house.</p>

<p>Now Beowulf will go and meet the Worm. He has an iron shield made,
and sets forth with eleven men and the thrall the thirteenth. He comes
to the ness, and speaks to his men, telling them of his past days, and
gives them his last greeting: then he cries out a challenge to the Worm,
who comes forth, and the battle begins: Beowulf's sword will not bite on
the Worm. Wiglaf eggs on the others to come to Beowulf's help, and goes
himself straightway, and offers himself to Beowulf; the Worm comes on
again, and Beowulf breaks his sword Nægling on him, and the Worm wounds
Beowulf. Wiglaf smites the Worm in the belly; Beowulf draws his ax, and
between them they slay the Worm.</p>

<p>Beowulf now feels his wounds, and knows that he is hurt deadly; he
sits down by the wall, and Wiglaf bathes his wounds. Beowulf speaks,
tells how he would give his armour to his son if he had one; thanks God
that he has not sworn falsely or done guilefully; and prays Wiglaf to
bear out the treasure that he may see it before he dies.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">x</span>
Wiglaf fetches out the treasure, and again bathes Beowulf's wounds;
Beowulf speaks again, rejoices over the sight of the treasure; gives to
Wiglaf his ring and his armour, and bids the manner of his bale-fire.
With that he passes away. Now the dastards come thereto and find Wiglaf
vainly bathing his dead lord. He casteth shame upon them with great
wrath. Thence he sends a messenger to the barriers of the town, who
comes to the host, and tells them of the death of Beowulf. He tells
withal of the old feud betwixt the Geats and the Swedes, and how these,
when they hear of the death of the king, will be upon them. The warriors
go to look on Beowulf, and find him and the Worm lying dead together.
Wiglaf chooses out seven of them to go void the treasure-house, after
having bidden them gather wood for the bale-fire. They shove the Worm
over the cliff into the sea, and bear off the treasure in wains. Then
they bring Beowulf's corpse to bale, and they kindle it; a&nbsp;woman
called the wife of aforetime, it may be Hygd, widow of Hygelac, bemoans
him: and twelve children of the athelings ride round the bale, and
bemoan Beowulf and praise him: and thus ends the poem.</p>

Finn episode in <i>Beowulf</i> appears to be part of a Finn epic, of
which only the merest fragment, called the <i>Fight at Finnsburg</i>, is
extant. The following conjectured outline of the whole
<span class = "pagenum">183</span>
<a name = "page183" id = "page183"> </a>
story is based on this fragment and on the Beowulf episode; Finn, king
of the Frisians, had carried off Hildeburh, daughter of Hoc, probably
with her consent. Her father, Hoc, seems to have pursued the fugitives,
and to have been slain in the fight which ensued on his overtaking them.
After the lapse of some twenty years Hoc's sons, Hnæf and Hengest, are
old enough to undertake the duty of avenging their father's death. They
make an inroad into Finn's country, and a battle takes place in which
many warriors, among them Hnæf and a son of Finn, are killed. Peace is
then solemnly concluded, and the slain warriors are burnt. As the year
is too far advanced for Hengest to return home, he and those of his men
who survive remain for the winter in the Frisian country with Finn. But
Hengest's thoughts dwell constantly on the death of his brother Hnæf,
and he would gladly welcome any excuse to break the peace which had been
sworn by both parties. His ill-concealed desire for revenge is noticed
by the Frisians, who anticipate it by themselves attacking Hengest and
his men whilst they are sleeping in the hall. This is the night attack
described in the <i>Fight at Finnsburg</i>. It would seem that after a
brave and desperate resistance Hengest himself falls in this fight at
the hands of the son of Hunlaf (<a href = "#line1143">66</a>), but two
of his retainers, Guthlaf and Oslaf, succeed in cutting their way
through their enemies and in escaping to their own land. They return
with fresh troops, attack and slay Finn, and carry his queen Hildeburh
back to the Daneland.</p>

Beowulf tells Hygelac that her father has betrothed her to Ingeld,
prince of the Heathobards, in the hope of settling the feud between the
two peoples. But he prophesies that the hope will prove vain: for an old
Heathobard warrior, seeing a Danish chieftain accompany Freawaru to
their court laden with Heathobard spoils, will incite the son of the
former owner of the plundered treasure to revenge, until blood is shed,
and the feud is renewed. That this was what afterwards befell, we learn

Eadgils. He invades the land of the Geats, which has harboured the
rebels, slays Heardred, son of Hygelac, and then retreats before
Beowulf. At a later time Beowulf avenges the death of Heardred by
supporting Eadgils, "son of Ohthere" (<a href = "#line2393">137</a>), in
an invasion of Sweden, in which Onela is slain. <i>See also</i> <a href

<p>Ongentheow, father of Onela and Ohthere, was a former king of the
Swedes. The earlier strife between the Swedes and the Geats, in which he
is the chief figure, is fully related by the messenger (<a href =
"#chapXL">164</a>) who brings the tidings of Beowulf's death. In
retaliation for the marauding invasions of Onela and Ohthere (<a href =

queen prisoner. Ongentheow in return invaded the land of her captor,
whom he slew, and rescued his wife (<a href = "#line2923">165</a>); but
in his hour of triumph he was attacked in his turn by Hygelac near

Scylfings" (<a href = "#chapXXXVI">149</a>), and in another passage the
name is apparently applied to the Geats (<a href = "#line3004">170</a>);
